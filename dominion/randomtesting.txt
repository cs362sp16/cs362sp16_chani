I used an oracle function and a main function for my tests.

I had many problems with my tests. Several times they seem to freeze, either from an infinite loop
or some type of runtime error. The few times I've been able to get coverage for them, I achieved
100% code coverage for adventurer and council_room. I don't have 100% coverage for feast.

I'm unable to replicate or diagnose the bug that causes my tests to freeze. It seems like it occurs randomly.
I tried using GDB to trace it but I'm forced to assume there is some type of input that is generated that
my code does not like. I've added break, return, and print statements everywhere I can and can't find 
what is causing the freeze.

When comparing the working coverage with the unit tests, it appeared that I got better coverage from the 
random tests. This is likely because my unit tests do not cover all possible cases. The random tests also
keep track of my succeeding and failing tests which is helpful.
