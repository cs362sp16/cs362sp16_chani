playDom seems to be bugged. I can't get the test to fail. Will need to revisit.

Also I was testing the adventurer card previously. I don't know why but it kept seg faulting
	when I reached that code. I had to switch cards to get it to compile at all. Will also
	need to revisit. Either cardEffects or the card itself is bugged.
