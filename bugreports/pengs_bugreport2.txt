In pengs's dominion.c, the tribute card has an error. 

Reproduce: This was not reproduced by me but I caught it through a random generation of my 
random tester. It could be reproduced by running a unit test on specifically the tribute card.
Even then it'd be hard to check for the error unless there was a condition in the unit test to
check the values of the next player's discard pile.

Bug: The for loop from line 897 to 902 is supposed to increment through every card in the 
next player's discard pile and puts them in the next player's discard pile. 
On line 901, "state->discardCount[nextPlayer]--;" lowers the upper limit of the for loop. This
means that any card that is in the discard pile that is higher than the upper limit are lost.
The next player's discard pile is then filled with meaningless -1s.

Fix: Delete line 901. After the for loop, add "state->discardCount[nextPlayer] = 0;".

Severity: Low - It's a wonder that my random tester even found this bug. I suspect that the average players
would almost never notice any problems caused by this.

Priority: Low - It is not a severe bug. The cards that are supposed to be discarded are just lost, so it
does not cause any bad effects.
